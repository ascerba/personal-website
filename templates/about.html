    <p class="subtitle">Me and my site.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Alex Scerba. For as long as I remember, I've been surrounded by people who tinkered and had a knack for repair and fixing. When the washing machine would go out, or the car started making a noise, we wouldn't call a repair man or go to the dealer. "It's just a machine, open it up and see what wrong" has been a part of my vocabulary for a long time and has been a major influence on how I lead my life.</p>
    <p>In late elementary school, I was put into astronomy and tech camps at our local observatory. I attended them until highschool, at which point I started helping with the same camps and working on projects under another program they offered. The instructors were NASA engineers, astronomers, and science educators. This was my intro to the land of computers and engineering. Already surrounded by people that liked to fix stuff around the house, observing the kinds of things possible and being encouraged to build and program new things that would further our knowlegde of the universe lead me on my path to enrolling in the Milwaukee School of Engineering for a degree in computer science. It was at this time I built my website. It was out of jealousy actually... ; &rpar;. Another student posted his website in the "introduce yourself to the class" section. The site was fine enough. I sure didn't have one, but I had already written a webpage for a highschool presentation &lpar;That's another story&rpar; and felt I could do it bigger and better. With my vision in mind, I learned the basics of local web hosting and multipage development and eventually got a site deployed before the school year &lpar;I didn't end up posting it on the intro board&rpar;. My time at MSOE was pretty good, but it was less than a year after the start of Covid, so it was far from the standard college experience. I enjoyed my courses well enough and was learning a lot, but I started to feel that it wasn't for me. I took sketching and drawing back up as a hobby early in the year, and by the time the third trimester came around, I decided that I was done. I wasn't really sure what to do, though. I knew that I liked drawing but knew I needed to get better and I liked working on motorcycles and had hopes for a while of starting up a small business making aftermarket parts or doing builds &lpar;This was definitely a pipe dream at the time, but I needed something to go on&rpar;. Someone had to be behind the design of cars and motorcycles, so I did a search for schools that taught automotive design. Two schools showed up. CCS in Michigan and Art Center in California. CCS was cheaper, closer, and still looked like a great school, so I scrambled to put together a <a href="/projects/CCSEntryPortfolio">sketch portfolio</a> to apply with, and I was accepted for the upcoming year.</p>
    <p>CCS was an eye opener and intimidating. No longer did I have a leg up in the curriculum. Most of my classmates had been drawing for a decent portion of their lives or had been thinking about automotive design and cars, so they had a lot of interesting ideas. I had no clue what I was doing, other than I knew I liked motorcycles, computers, and building stuff.</p>
