  <p>While figuring out how to pass the time, a friend linked to the /r/milwaukee subreddit. Out of boredom, I opened up the link. To my surprise (I’m not that in the loop), people were posting about an air show going on. It was 1:30 PM when I found the event page and saw that the Blue Angels were on for 3:00 PM. Since I needed to be in Milwaukee by 5:00 PM anyways and I haven’t seen an air show, I packed up the Sportster and hit the road. As I came off I-794 by the art museum, I was surprised to see not that much traffic at first. That fallacy was soon broken. I found a spot a few minutes after the show start time, though, and right as I got off the bike to find a spot to sit the Blue Angels flew just overhead in formation. It was loud… but awesome. Sure, I’ve been on an airliner, heard loud engines, and ride a relatively loud motorcycle, but the sound and feeling of several jet fighters flying some eighty feet above is something I haven’t experienced. Here are a few of the videos I captured:</p>

  <p>Overall it was a great experience. My only regret is having to hurry to get there, otherwise I would have parked somewhere else and walked down. The streets were packed… everywhere near the lake and the surrounding area. So if you want to go in the future, definitely show up early and walk/bike/skate/scooter down. You’ll be much happier regardless of the weather. Sitting in locked traffic for an hour trying to get away from the lake was a bit insane. Having some plans that let you hang around for a while is even better.</p>
  <p>Anyways, the EAA Fly-in is this week in Oshkosh, and I absolutely plan on attending.</p>
