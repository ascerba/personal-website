          <p>My name is Alex Scerba, a Junior in the College for Creative Studies: Transportation Design program in Detroit, MI.</p>
          <p>Growing up in Lake Geneva, WI, I developed a passion for making and tinkering, which lead me down the path of industrial design. I love working with my hands, fixing up and riding motorcycles and cars, and learning new skills.</p>
          <p>In addition to sketching, rendering, and modeling, my hobby skills include programming (<a href="https://github.com/ascerba/personal-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this website</a>), bookbinding, and woodworking.</p>
          <blockquote>"It's just a machine. Open it up and see what's wrong."</blockquote>
          <p>This summer, I hope to secure an internship to learn more skills in the design and manufacturing industry.</p>
